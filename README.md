# LedgerLoops

This repository holds the code you need to run a LedgerLoops node.
:warning: **It's currently out of service for a complete rewrite.**
Following [new insights in 2024](https://github.com/ledgerloops/ledgerloops.com/issues/92)
that require loop detection to work on undirected graphs rather than on directed ones,
I'm rewriting this code from scratch.

See `node ./src/cofi-sim.js` for a small code example from 2023.

See also https://github.com/ledgerloops/snap-checker/issues/21 for some code examples from 2018.
